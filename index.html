  <span class = "italic"><p>*If you don't have time to cook or want something simple, opt for something with a source of protein with some vegetables, like chicken with asparagus.</p></span>

  <br><br>



</p>The goal here is to lose weight. <br><br>In the simplest terms, that means eating less calories than you use. 

<br><br>
It gets more complicated than that, but unless you're trying to be a pro bodybuilder, calories are all that matter.<br><br>

On average, women need to eat about 1400 colaries to lose weight. Men need about 1800. But it's different for everybody. <br><br>There are a lot of factors(height, physical activity, genetics, etc) that affect this, so don't pay too much attention to those numbers.

<br><br>But you do need to find out what your own number is.

<br><br>So get used to counting calories you eat. It will help you even more to see if you can't figure out how many calories you burn throughout the day(approximately).
 

<br><br>Keep it around the 1400 or 1800 marks, and create your portion sizes for each meal accordingly. 

<br><br>Weigh yourself at least once a week and record it. That will help you figure out if you need to eat less. If you're not seeing lower numbers, it means you're eating too many calories! 
` 

<br><br>

This diet leans heavily towards the <span class = "dark">Paleo Diet</span>. 

<br><br>Basically it means most of the food here is what humans were <span class = "italic">meant</span> to eat. Think meat and vegetables. And eggs. Lots of eggs. 

<br><br>You know, everything humans have eaten since the beginning of time, before we started manufacturing food in factories and labs. 

<br><br>That's when everybody started to gain weight. All processed foods(chips, pasta, etc) should be avoided like the plague. That includes fruit juices. 

<br><br> Extra pounds tend to come from these foods because they're specifically designed to be addictive and have a fuck-ton of calories. I'd say the biggest part of this diet is to avoid extra snacks like that. If you do snack, eat things like carrots or celery.<br><br>  

Lettuce wraps are your friend. Soda and chips are your enemies.

This diet is ONLY water. It makes it difficult to lose weight when you're getting calories from something other than your food.
<br><br>

This diet also assumes basic exercise for at LEAST 4 days a week. I don't mean some crazy, balls-to-the-wall P90X type shit.

<br><br>I'm talking about 30-60 minutes of physical activity. If nothing else, go for a 30 minute walk. That's fine too.

<br><br>Don't overthink it, but don't skip it either. We have to expend calories. 

<br><br>Plus, if you exercise a lot, you'll burn more calories which can allow you to throw in a cheat day sometime in the near future.
